Talk about usage of hash function in python data structures


Hash function in python use to optimize search, retrieval operations and faster data access.
It takes an input and converts it into a value, typically an integer value.This generated value is used as an index to store and retrieve data in data structures.
Used in two essential Python data structures, Two ways are implemented using a hash table:

1-Dictionaries :
Python calculates the hash value of the key using the hash function.The hash value is used as an index to store the key-value pair in a memory location. When you want to retrieve a value associated with a specific key, Python calculates the hash of the key again and uses it to quickly locate the value in the memory.

2-Sets :
When add an element to a set using the add() method, Python calculates the hash value
of the element and uses it as an index to store the element in a memory location.
